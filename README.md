# Digital Marketing Agency Website

This is a responsive and modern website created as my **final project** for the **Web Engineering** subject in university. It represents a digital marketing agency and is designed with multiple interactive and well-structured pages.

## Project Overview

The website includes the following pages:

- **Home Page (`index.html`)** – Highlights services, process, and key selling points
- **About Us (`about.html`)** – Introduces the agency’s mission, values, and leadership team
- **Sign In Page (`signin.html`)** – Allows users to create an account with input validation
- **Log In Page (`login.html`)** – Login interface (front-end only)
- **style.css** – Contains all styling rules for layout, responsiveness, and animations
- **script.js** – Handles form validation, alerts, and user interaction logic


## Key Features

-  Responsive design for all screen sizes (desktop and mobile)
-  Form validation (email format, password match, required fields)

-  Structured content using semantic HTML5
-  Visual hierarchy using custom CSS
-  JavaScript interactions for user feedback

## Technologies Used
